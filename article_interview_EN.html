                    <br>I have a military brother and a ex-military father.
                    <br>For one year now, I have been
                    <a class="lien claire" href="lexique_EN.html#r">a reservist</a> in the army. I am part of the Ecole Navale group. I want to become an officer, or a non-commissioned officer.
                    <br>I like outside activities: trails, running, cycling. I love the mountains, the forest... The nature!</p>

                <h2>Women and army</h2>

                <h3>Why did you go to a military prep school? What interests you in the army?</h3>
                <p>If I went to a military preparatory school, it was to become a naval officer. Of course the level is very hard, that's why my plan B, to become a non-commissioned officer is not excluded.</p>
                <p>From my experience, from what I have been told, the army is really made for me. With the reserves, I learned to like the terrain, shooting, combat... I also like order, discipline and rigour. I like mutual aid, cohesion... And of course: sport, surpassing oneself, these things are in my heart.</p>
                <p>And if I can defend and represent my beautiful country, I don't ask more. Traditions and history of France have also pushed me in this direction.</p>

                <h3>In your opinion, is the army more difficult for a woman?</h3>
                <p>Today, we have 20% of women in our ranks, all corps combined (the army is around 10%). Indeed, these numbers speak for themselves, we are a long way from achieving exact parity. I think that for many people (men and women) the army is not really adapted for women.</p>
                <p>From what I can live with, I can see that the situation change. In terms of physical aptitude, the standards are different, for example: 12 pull-ups for girls and 17 for guys in the competition. Physionomically, women do not have the same muscles as men.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, this does not stop us from surpassing ourselves. As for me, I train to attain the level required of the boys, to prove to them that we are all equally capable, even if it requires more work. The merit is all the greater.</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>Do you perceive a difference between men and women in the army? (position, salary, tasks)</h3>
                <p>For tasks, treatment, position... To my knowledge there is no difference. Of course, there has not yet been a women marine commodo but I hope it will happen soon! In addition, there is no salary inequality!</p>

                <h3>Do you think that the army is a more gender-equal environment than other?</h3>
                <p>More equal in the army? In terms of salary, yes. After that, the army is far from being 50% of women. After that, there are still major problems: misogyny, harassment, aggression...</p>
                <blockquote>In the army, there are traditions that must be preserved but we must also move ahead, progress, and women in the military profession are part of that. For some soldiers, it's difficult to accept this.</blockquote>

                <h3>During the World War 2, do you think that women were welcomed in the Resistance?</h3>
                <p>Of course women had a very important role in the Resistance. I think that they must have surprised many people. Seventy years ago, we probably didn't imagine that a woman could fight like men for France!</p>

                <h3>Do you think that women's activity in the war has played a role in the evolution of the vision of women in society?</h3>
                <p>Of course the Second World War changed the image of women. The world realised the importance of women. Whether in the revolution or in industry (Rosie the Riveter ) or in the home.</p>

                <h2>Feminism today</h2>

                <h3>Are you feminist? Why? If yes, what are you doing for the cause?</h3>
                <p>Feminist, me? I have long questioned myself on this subject. I admire this movement, but unfortunately, as in any movement, there are excesses. Feminism is sometimes defined incorrectly. I support feminism if it supports the values of equality, solidarity, emancipation and freedom for all sexes!</p>
                <p>For the cause, I try to be myself, to influence by discussing with different people, I try at my level to educate younger people. And I hope to have a greater impact on society as my career develops.</p>

                <h3>Do you think women are equal to men?</h3>
                <p>I believe that women are fully equal to men in intellectual, social, political, civic terms... The physiognomic aspect remains a problem, the reality is that we have some muscles less developed than men. Obviously, our physique, our body is different. But these differences shouldn't be imposed on the equality of men and women.</p>

                    <figcaption>Draw of equality between men and women</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h3>What did we do to attain man-woman equality?</h3>
                <p>There are still problems to be solved: salary inequalities, misogyny, harassment, sexual assaults, rapes, anti-abortion laws, pressure on women...</p>
                <blockquote>Education and prevention are for me the best weapons to fight against these problems.</blockquote>

                <h3>Do you agree with all the actions taken/problems identified by feminists?</h3>
                <p>I admire the vast majority of the actions of feminists even if, and I imagine this is true of all movements, there are extremists. I don't agree at all with actions that attack the male gender.</p>
                <blockquote>True feminism wants to give women more rights in order to achieve men's rights, not to take men's rights.</blockquote>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>One last thing to say?</h2>
                <p>Be a woman today is not always easy, you must to fight. It's difficult for many. But you have to be proud of who you are.</p>
                <p>A Simone de Beauvoir’s quote comes to my mind:</p>
                <blockquote>Never forget that it will only take a political, economic or religious crisis for women's rights to be questioned. These rights can never be taken for grante. You will must to be vigilant during your life.</blockquote>
