                <p class="chapo">In 1940, after the General de Gaulle’s call, the Resistance in France begins. Everybody who has a patriotic spirit or are opposed to the German dictatorship, were engaged in it. Same women. However, in addition to fighting the enemy, they must combat stereotypes that dictated their place, against laws limiting their freedoms, and men who don’t believing in their abilities. During the Word War 2, Women of the French Resistance had to show their power.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="div">
                <h2>Women's place is in the home</h2>
                <p>On 11 July 1940, the Vichy regime was installed by Marshal Petain. It was not in favour of women. It was simple, the men went to war and the women stayed to take care of the children. Numerous laws were put in this direction: it was forbidden to employ married women, abortion became a crime against the state, abandoning the home became a criminal offence, divorce was harder to obtain... Not to mention that women had no political or social status. They had no rights!</p>
                <p>In more, the Pétain government blamed women for the decline of France. There were few boys who born, so few future soldiers. The role of women during the war was to be loving mothers and wives, taking care of the home until their husbands returned at home.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for the Vichy regime, women could be patriotic, rebellious and rebellious as much as men!</p>
                <p>Marguerite Gonnet, a division leader of the Resistance was arrested for distributing underground newspapers. When a Nazi colonel asked her how a mother of 9 children could have taken arms, she replied:</p>
                <blockquote>Quite simply, colonel, because the men had let them down.</blockquote>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The Resistance when we are a girl</h2>
                <p>It was very difficult for a woman to enter in the Resistance. They had to prove their value even more than the men who did not believe that a woman could survive and be useful in war. But some post were occupied by more women than men! It was the Unarmed Resistance.</p>
                
                <h3>The Unarmed Resistance</h3>
                <p>The majority of the resistance women were liaison officers and had to pass on messages, arms or money. For this, many used bicycles. They could travel on roads that were less frequented, so less controlled. Colette Peries-Martinez, a liaison officer, said:</p>
                <blockquote>At the Liberation, we were ready for the Tour de France!</blockquote>
                <p>Indeed, information had to be transmitted imperatively, so women had to go on the road whatever the time and distance. In more, they were less suspected by the soldiers than the men. So they were a real advantage for the Resistance. Judged innocent and harmless, they moved more easily.</p>

                    <figcaption>Picture of the parade of the liaison officers during the Libération</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Some of them welcomed escaped prisoners, allies, resistance fighters and Jews into their homes. Their homes were essential relay points for the Resistance.</p>
                <p>Others were in charge of clandestine newspapers, like Berty Albrecht, secretary, editor and creator of 4 resistance newspapers!</p>
                <p>However, even if they were not at the front, if they were caught by the Gestapo or the police, they received the same punishments as the men: deportation, torture, execution. This was the situation of Berty Albrecht, deported and tortured in 1943 in the Fresnes prison in Paris.</p>

                <h3>The Armed Resistance</h3>
                <p>Very few women were active in the armed resistance, as this required the confidence of the men. They were generally in charge of locating places, transporting weapons, participating in sabotage of railway lines and prisoner rescue. Others were specialists in explosives.</p>
                <p>Lucie Aubrac, as well as being a high school teacher encouraging her students to fight injustice, wrote articles and took part in many escapes. The most famous be the one where she saved her husband.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Paulette Jacquier was in charge of sabotaging railway lines. She later joined,
                    <a class="lien claire" href="lexique_EN.html#m">maquis</a> then
                    <a class="lien claire" href="lexique_EN.html#f">the Forces Francaises Libres</a>. 
                    She was the first and only woman in the 1st division where she was
                    <a class="lien claire" href="lexique_EN.html#r">a rifleman-voltiger</a> in the front line.</p>
                <p>The Resistance was a less sexist environment than others, because the main criterion was the desire to fight the enemy.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>The post-war for women, an advance and a return to habits</h2>
                <p>After the war, there was a great advance for women. Women played an important role in the Resistance, so it's normal that they are honoured. They obtained the right to vote and to be elected, and were more present in municipal committees and councils. They could also join the army with the Personnel feminin de l'Armee de terre.</p>
                <p>However, in everyday life, everything is back like before. Men at work and women at home. Most of the women in the Resistance simply returned at their home and resumed their lives as women, mothers and wives. This was like that because of the desire to forget the war and everything connected with it.</p>
                <p>Very few women claimed to have been in the Resistance, as they did not want to give testimony, for fear to not be believed, and of remembering the horrors they had seen. The majority of their actions were not on the front line but intermediate actions, in the background, such as logistics, supply, liaison or scouting. These tasks, less impressive, were frequently forgotten.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Women managed to impose her in the Resistance, a man's world, and defended their country in different ways, proving their usefulness other than in a kitchen. General de Gaulle, conscious that without them the war would have been different, gave them equal rights with men. However, mentalities didn't evolve as fast. Many women returned to their original lives and men forgot what they had do.</p>
                <p>Despite this, we should not be denied the activity of women in the Resistance played a role in changing their condition, and inspires more and more people as their stories are told.</p>
